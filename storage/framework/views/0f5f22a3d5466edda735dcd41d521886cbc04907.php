                                <p>
                                  This family of God consists of students of Obafemi Awolowo University who have come together to worship, serve and play. We are predestined by God for eternity and good life on this earth. We are the church of the Bible, the church of Christ.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Worship</h5>
                                <p>
                                  It is ordered as seen in the Holy Scriptures. We follow the examples laid down by the apostles. They sang hymns, prayed, contributed for the welfare of one another, and ate the Lord’s Supper (Acts 2:40-47; 20: 6-7; I Cor. 16:1-2)
                                </p>
                                <h5>Members</h5>
                                <p>
                                Members are added to this body of believers by the Lord himself after they have heard the gospel, believed it, repented of their sins, confessed Jesus Christ and are baptized. These steps make them Christians. Thereafter, they are spiritually nourished by feeding on God’s word.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                In this group, there is joy everlasting because of the vivid assurance of eternal life by working day and night in his vineyard with gladness of heart in line with His promise that your labour in the Lord is not in vain. We invite you to join this lovely family.
                                </p>
